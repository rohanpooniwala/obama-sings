All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
Lover here, lover there Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love soandso
But now I've got to letitgo
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there everybody's high except me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone
Until now all I wanted do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love soandso
But now I've got to letitgo
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo
Lay back and let my feelings show
I, I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love soandso
But now I want to letitgo
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
Said I want to letitgo
Lay back and let the feelings show
