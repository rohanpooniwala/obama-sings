Load up on guns bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overbored self assured
And all I know are dirty words
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
With,the lights,out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I'm worse at what I do best
and for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
and always will until the end
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
With,the lights,out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah I guess it makes me smile
I found it's hard... hard to find
Oh well whatever never mind
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
Hello hello hello how low
With,the lights,out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
