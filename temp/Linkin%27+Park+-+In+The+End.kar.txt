3.. 2.. 1..
(It starts with...)
one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
(All I know...)
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
(It's so unreal...)
didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
(Watch you go...)
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far..
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all..
But in the end
It doesn't even matte............er
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try, keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme, to remind myself how
(I tried so hard..)
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised
(It got so far..)
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
(In the end..)
You kept everything inside and even though I tried,
it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far..
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all..
But in the end
It doesn't even matte............er
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should kno........ow
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should kno........ow
I tried so hard
And got so far..
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all..
But in the end
It doesn't even matte............er
